If you can't run Semplice, don't despair! The Semplice team is ready to
help you! We are especially interested in hearing about boot
problems, because in general they don't happen to only 0fone07 person.
We've either already heard about your particular problem and can dispense a
quick fix, or we would like to hear about it and work through it with you,
and the next user who comes up with the same problem will profit from your
experience!
